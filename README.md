# IndirectFireRange

## Overview

`IndirectFireRange` is a simple Fortran program that calculates the estimated range to a target square on a grid map. The program uses the size of each square in meters, the user's current square, and the target square to compute the range.

## Input Format

- **Square Size:** The size of each square in meters.
- **Current Square:** The user's current position on the grid (e.g., `A1`, `B4`).
- **Target Square:** The target's position on the grid (e.g., `C3`, `D5`).
